        <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Charlotte Bo</span></h1>
        <p>Hello guys. How are you? Hope you are doing well. As you can see my name is Charlotte, i am from Sweden, Stockholm<br/>
        but I have spent my whole life living here. I am violin instructor here in <bold>Nieces and nephews</bold>. Like other 3 partners I have been here from scratch
        <br/> I am 30 years old, I am engaged and hoping that i will get my own kid someday, but before then I want to enjoy with you guys. I want to spend quality time with you and music
            <br/>I was a slow learner so I will have full understanding if you are too, we will go slowly step by step. Only practice makes you perfect
            <br/>Hard work beats talent every day when talent isn't hard working. Keep that in mind guys and see you soon.
