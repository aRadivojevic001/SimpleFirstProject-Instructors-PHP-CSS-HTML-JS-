        <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m <span>Icelandic Cubicle</span></h1>
        <p>As you can see on a picture behind me I give my everything when I am playing music. For me music is life.
        <br/>I had rough childhood and was battling with depression and music was my exit even in that young age. After that i have spent whole my life working in music industry.
            <br/> I came here in <bold>Nieces and Nephews</bold> when I was 36, already with wife and 3 kids.I was on a tour my whole life,playing music and living country road style of life,
            <br/>but i came here to settle. And so i did. I can so you only that exactly because I am guy who is so passionate about music i can really teach you a lot.
            <br/>Because i want music world to have 1 more kid with new tunes who can experience things I had. Like I told you I already have 3 kids
            <br/> but other then that 3 I have 103 with who I bonded like they are my own.
